# Project Explanations

### Lab 3 - Screensaver
[The assignment](https://github.com/SRJoyce/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/f17_magd150_lab03_joyce/f17_magd150_lab03_joyce.pde) was to create a screensaver that mainly used mouse commands. I decided to make semi-transparent, vibrantly colored triangles that would stretch from its origin and follow the mouse as it moves around the screen. The colors of the triangles can be changed by holding up on the keyboard, and clicking the mouse will reset the program and clear the screen. Hitting escape will get the program out of fullscreen.

### Lab 4 - Pizza Turtle
Though the lab's offical name was not ["Pizza Turtle"](https://github.com/SRJoyce/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s17magd150lab04_joyce/s17magd150lab04_joyce.pde), it's what I've decided to name it, as the theme was "Oceans of Pizza." The goal of this assignment was to emphasize interactivity for a user while adherring to the theme. I made the window of the program resizable so the pizza turtle, while is gently swims through a sea of bubbles, can be squished and stretched by the user. Hitting the up key will inspire pizza turtle to move faster (or slower, depending on how cooperative he's feeling).

### Lab 6 - Day to Night
The day to night cycle I made for our [sixth lab](https://github.com/SRJoyce/MAGD-150-Assignments/commit/bb1279bf8ee38ad7ed241f8cf4634ec4db45836a) let the user fight against the fall of night by pressing the up key. The sky lights up as clouds hurridly move across the strangely purple, stary sky. The goal of the assingment was for us to get used to using classes in Processing, so most of this file has many attachments where the classes are stored.

### Lab 9 - Audio + Video
Our [audio and video assignment](https://github.com/SRJoyce/MAGD-150-Assignments/commit/68ab6065a78eef73a2ac296ba41b108e19e1ba7f) focused on using audio files retrived from Processing's free sound library, and video files either filmed by us or recorded using the live capture function. My class's theme was "Documentary," so I decided to have the viewer play the role of a newly recruited photographer working for a documentary team who were out searching for good pictures of house cats. The user can drag their mouse across the screen to focus their camera, then press the "a" key to turn their camera to face their fluffy subject.

### Lab 10 - 3D + Cameras, Lighting
This was one of our last [assignments](https://github.com/SRJoyce/MAGD-150-Assignments/commit/3d9a65070bb1c1b38327a363c6a65e262f56e62d), and the only one where we were required to work with 3D shapes. We worked in pairs for this one, so I created a 3D shape and my partner skillfully textured it. We then split up to add in camera commands and lighting. The user can steer the camera around the y-axis with the up and down keys, the x-axis with the left and right keys, and the z-axis with shift and alt (weird keys, yes). The strange shape can also be rotated around its central point with the mouse, just by moving it across the screen.
